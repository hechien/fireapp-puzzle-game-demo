# Fire.app Puzzle Game demo

This is an example project for my friend. I just teach her how to use Fire.app to make a game.

# How to play?

1. git clone it.
2. Watch the project by your Fire.app.
3. Make sure you enabled the built-in web server.
4. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:24681
5. That's it!

Just read the source codes, I added:

- _layout.erb
- index.html.erb
- coffeescripts/index.coffee
- sass/index.scss
